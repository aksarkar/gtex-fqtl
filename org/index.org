#+TITLE: Factored QTL analysis
#+SETUPFILE: setup.org

We develop /Factored QTL analysis/ (~fqtl~), a multivariate, sparse multiple
regression model to jointly identify causal eQTLs and tissues of action. The
key idea of our method is to assume that the matrix of effect sizes is low rank
and sparse, and use a novel Bayesian prior to estimate the posterior
distribution of that matrix.
